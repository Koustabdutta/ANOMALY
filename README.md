## 🔍 AUTO ANOMALY – Autoencoder + LSTM Based Anomaly Detection

This notebook implements a hybrid anomaly detection system using **Autoencoders** and **LSTM** networks. It is designed to identify anomalies in time-series data without labeled outputs. Ideal for applications in **cybersecurity**, **IoT**, **network monitoring**, and **sensor data analysis**.

### 🧠 Key Features
- Autoencoder for pattern learning and reconstruction error detection  
- LSTM for sequence-based anomaly detection  
- Threshold-based anomaly classification  
- Data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization in one notebook  
- Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and Matplotlib  

### 📁 File
- `AUTO ANOMALY.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow

### ✅ Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
